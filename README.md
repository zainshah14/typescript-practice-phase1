# Investment Calculator (TypeScript Demo – Section 4)

This is a small demo project built while learning TypeScript.  
It calculates yearly growth for an investment using compound interest.

### Contribution Timing
This version uses **end-of-year contributions** —  
interest is applied first, then the yearly contribution is added afterward.

### How to Run
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Open a terminal inside it.
3. Run these commands one by one:

npm install
npm run build
npm start

Here’s what those mean:
- `npm install` → download the libraries your code needs.
- `npm run build` → convert your TypeScript (`.ts`) code into JavaScript (`.js`).
- `npm start` → actually *run* your compiled code.

### How to Test (after we add Jest)
Later, you’ll be able to type:

npm test

That will run your automated test cases.

### Notes
- Written in **TypeScript**.
- Uses a clean structure with types for inputs and results.
- Next steps: add input validation and test coverage.
